Dual-Band Cross-Coupled Branchline Coupler Design
Designed and simulated a compact, high-performance dual-band branchline coupler operating at 2.5 GHz and 5 GHz using microstrip technology on a Teflon substrate. Applied Even-Odd Mode and ABCD matrix analysis to optimize impedance scaling for dual-frequency operation. Leveraged AWR Microwave Office to perform S-parameter analysis, return loss, and isolation optimization—achieving over 30 dB isolation at target frequencies.

This hands-on project deepened my understanding of RF system design and helped me build skills in high-frequency PCB layout, signal integrity, impedance matching, and RF simulation—critical for roles in wireless communication, microwave engineering, and hardware design.
